# Abstract


Dementia is a pervasive and challenging condition, affecting
millions of individuals and their families globally. The "Memory" project seeks to
address the multifaceted needs of those suffering from dementia by integrating
advanced technology and therapeutic interventions. This innovative system aims
to enhance patient safety, provide real-time health monitoring, and offer
supportive therapies to improve the overall quality of life for dementia patients.
At the core of the "Memory" project is a robust location tracking feature that
utilizes the patient’s smartphone to monitor their movements continuously. When
a patient steps outside a predefined safe radius, an immediate alert is sent to the
caregiver’s device, accompanied by the patient’s current location. This feature
ensures quick response times and helps prevent situations where the patient
might wander and become lost, a common and dangerous occurrence for
individuals with dementia.
In addition to location tracking, "Memory" incorporates a health monitoring
system using a Raspberry Pi connected to a Photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor.
This wearable device tracks the patient’s blood oxygen levels and heart rate,
providing critical real-time data. If the readings fall below safe thresholds,
notifications are automatically sent to emergency contacts and healthcare
providers. The continuous health data is transmitted securely via blockchain
technology, ensuring privacy and integrity while allowing doctors to monitor the
patient’s health remotely and make informed decisions.
Beyond safety and health monitoring, "Memory" also focuses on enhancing the
patient’s cognitive function and emotional well-being through therapeutic
interventions. The project includes music therapy, where personalized playlists
can be played through a smartphone app to reduce anxiety and improve mood.
Visual therapy exercises, such as puzzles and memory games, are also
incorporated to stimulate cognitive function and enhance visual processing skills.
Additionally, the app provides daily reminders for medications, appointments, and
routine activities, helping patients maintain a structured routine and fostering
independence.
